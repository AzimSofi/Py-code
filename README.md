# Tic-Tac-Toe
I've created a tic-tac-toe game that can be played on the console, but I have yet to implement it in a GUI using PyQt6.

**Getting Started**
To run the game on the console, simply run the following command in your terminal:
python game.py

To run the game with a GUI, you will need to install PyQt6. Once you have installed PyQt6, run the following command in your terminal:
python GUI_pyqt6.py

**Dependencies**
This project relies on the following thrid-party libraries:
- Pyside6: https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python

**Usage**
Once the game is running, you can start playing by following the prompts on the screen.

**Issues**
If you run into any issues while playing the game, please let me know by creating an issue in the issue tracker.
